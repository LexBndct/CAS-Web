The band's music often features ethereal vocals, slow tempos, and minimalist instrumentation, creating a tranquil and atmospheric listening experience. Their lyrics often explore themes of love, desire, and intimacy.
    
    The band gained significant attention with the release of their self-titled debut album in 2017, which featured tracks like "Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby" and "Apocalypse." Their music has been described as romantic and nostalgic, drawing comparisons to artists like Mazzy Star and Lana Del Rey.
